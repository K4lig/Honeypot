## 🚨 Problem
In modern cloud environments, public-facing services like SSH are under constant attack by automated botnets and malicious actors. Organizations often lack visibility into **who** is attacking them, **how** they are bypassing authentication, and **what commands** they execute once inside. Without this intelligence, it is difficult to proactively harden defenses against real-world TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

## 🛠️ Solution
I designed and deployed a scalable threat detection architecture using **Infrastructure as Code (Docker)** and cloud services. The system decoys attackers into a controlled environment and centralizes telemetry for analysis.

### Architecture
* **Cloud Provider:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute Engine.
* **Honeypot Node:** Ubuntu Server running **Cowrie** (a medium-interaction SSH/Telnet honeypot) to emulate a vulnerable Linux shell.
* **SIEM Node:** **Wazuh (v4.9)** deployed via **Docker Compose** for log aggregation, correlation, and alerting.
* **Integration:** Custom Wazuh Agent configuration to ingest unstructured JSON logs from Cowrie.
* **Detection:** Developed custom XML decoding rules to map Cowrie events (logins, commands, downloads) to security alerts.

**Technologies Used:** `Wazuh`, `Docker`, `Cowrie`, `Python`, `Bash`, `Google Cloud Platform`, `Linux (Ubuntu)`.

## 📈 Outcome
The project resulted in a fully functional Threat Intelligence pipeline capable of:

1.  **Real-Time Detection:** Successfully detected and alerted on brute-force attempts and successful unauthorized logins within milliseconds.
2.  **Attacker Profiling:** Captured attacker shell interaction, including specific commands entered (`whoami`, `curl`, `wget`) and malware download attempts.
3.  **Visualization:** Built a dashboard visualizing the geolocation of attackers, most used credentials, and attack frequency over time.

This project demonstrates practical skills in **Cloud Security**, **Log Analysis**, **Detection Engineering**, and **Containerization**.

## 🚀 How to Replicate

### Step 1: Deploy the SIEM (Docker)
```bash```
```git clone [https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-docker.git](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-docker.git) -b v4.9.0```
```cd wazuh-docker/single-node```
```docker compose -f generate-indexer-certs.yml run --rm generator```
```docker compose up -d```

### Step 2: Configure the Honeypot (Cowrie)

# Clone and install Cowrie
git clone [http://github.com/cowrie/cowrie](http://github.com/cowrie/cowrie)
cd cowrie
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Configure listening port to 2222 in cowrie.cfg
bin/cowrie start
Step 3: Install Wazuh Agent & Connect
